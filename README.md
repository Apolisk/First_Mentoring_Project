# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet project as a result of @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Include file output path to the cli flags (`-o output.txt`).
2. Start learning the concurrency section in Go Tour.
3. Think about ways to introduce the concurrency to **passgen**.
