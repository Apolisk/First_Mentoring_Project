# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet project as a result of @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Research, think about, and describe the possible ways to generate a password.
2. Remember to create a separate branch and the pull request.
3. Play around with one new feature in password generation.
