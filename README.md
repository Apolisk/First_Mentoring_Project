# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet project as a result of @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Research, think about, and describe the possible ways to generate a password.
2. Finish the `passgen` package implementation.
3. Use the new `passgen` package in the `cmd/passgen/main.go`.
4. Implement the `Specials` generation as a `passgen.Config` option.
5. Check the `github.com/spf13/cobra` usage examples.
