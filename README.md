# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet-project as a result of the @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Research, think about, describe the possible ways to generate a password.
2. Set up the project locally using Goland, Git.
3. Implement a basic nubmer password generation (your input is a password length, your output is a random number withing this length)
