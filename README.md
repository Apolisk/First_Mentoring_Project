# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet project as a result of @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Research, think about, and describe the possible ways to generate a password.
2. Ask for the number of passwords to generate.
3. Change uppercase flag to letters.
4. Write the output to txt file.
