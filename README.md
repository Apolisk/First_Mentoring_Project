# passgen

**passgen** is my first ever pet project as a result of @demget's mentoring. It allows a user to generate a set of unique passwords with the given configuration.

## TODO

1. Research, think about, and describe the possible ways to generate a password.
2. Play around with `github.com/spf13/cobra` to integrate it later.
3. Include file output path to the cli flags (`-o output.txt`).
